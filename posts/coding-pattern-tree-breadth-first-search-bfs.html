                    <h2>Does This Pattern Solve Your Problem?</h2>

                    <p>• Tree data structure: The input data is in the form of a tree, or the cost of transforming it into a tree is low.• Not a wide tree: If the tree being searched is very wide. In such scenarios, the time complexity of breadth-first search may become prohibitive.• Level-by-level traversal: The solution dictates traversing the tree one level at a time, for example, to find the level order traversal of the nodes of a tree or a variant of this ordering.• Solution near the root: We have reason to believe that the solution is near the root of the tree. Instead, if the solution is near the leaves of the tree, BFS may not be efficient because it exhaustively explores nodes level by level. In such cases, depth-first search (DFS) would be more suitable for traversing deep into the tree.</p>
