                    <h2>What</h2>
<p>It involves counting the occurrences of elements in a given data structure, mostly an array or a string, and using this frequency information to solve the problem efficiently. The pattern can be divided into two main phases:• Counting phase: This is to iterate through the elements of the data structure and count the frequency of each element. We can use different data structures to achieve this, such as hash maps, dictionaries, arrays, or even simple variables.• Utilization phase: Once the frequencies are calculated, we can use this information to solve the specific problem at hand. This could involve any task that benefits from knowing the frequency of elements, such as: ◦ Find the most frequent element. ◦ Identify elements that occur only once. ◦ Check if two arrays are permutations of each other. ◦ Check if the player wins the game.</p>

                    <h2>Real World Applications</h2>
<p>Imagine you work for a big online shop like Amazon, and you need to suggest products to users based on their purchase history. There is a massive database with millions of users and the items they’ve bought. To find out which products are popular among each user, a count for each product purchased is required. Doing it manually with traditional methods would be highly inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, you would need to set up a system that automatically keeps track of how often each product is purchased by each user.It’s like having a digital tally counter for every product and every user. This way, when it’s time to make recommendations, you can do it efficiently because you already have a clear picture of which products each user prefers.• DNA sequence analysis: In genomics, frequency counting is used to analyze the frequency of nucleotides or amino acids in DNA or protein sequences. This information is used for tasks such as identifying genetic variations, predicting protein structure, and studying evolutionary relationships.• Video streaming: To enhance the video streaming user experience, revamp the continue-watching bar that will return the most frequently watched show.• E-commerce: Show product recommendations with items that are frequently viewed together.• Clickstream analysis: In web analytics, frequency counting is used to analyze the frequency of user interactions, such as page views, clicks, and conversions. This helps in understanding user behavior, optimizing website design, and improving user experience.</p>
