Backtracking,"Imagine we’re planning an exciting road trip through a city, aiming to visit all the places we want to see while covering the shortest distance possible. However, there are some conditions we must follow: we can’t revisit the same place more than once, and we must end up back where we started. This problem, known as the city road trip problem, requires finding the optimal route that satisfies these conditions. It’s a classic example where the concept of backtracking comes into play, allowing us to explore different paths until we find the shortest one that fulfills all the conditions.

let’s look at a backtracking approach to solve the same problem. With backtracking, we can start by picking a place and choose the next place to visit that’s close and follows our conditions. We move back (backtrack) to the previous place if the current place has been visited before or if we cannot move forward to any place from here. We check these conditions on each of our choices because we do not want to break any of our road trip rules. We keep doing this, choosing, checking conditions, and backtracking until we’ve visited all the places according to the requirements. At every step, we choose the closest place, ensuring we have chosen the shortest path to visit all the places we want to see.",No content,,"Generate a string of n balanced parentheses.

Knowing What to Track,,"Imagine you work for a big online shop like Amazon, and you need to suggest products to users based on their purchase history. 

There is a massive database with millions of users and the items they’ve bought. To find out which products are popular among each user, a count for each product purchased is required. 

Doing it manually with traditional methods would be highly inefficient and time-consuming. 

 Therefore, you would need to set up a system that automatically keeps track of how often each product is purchased by each user.

It’s like having a digital tally counter for every product and every user. 

This way, when it’s time to make recommendations, you can do it efficiently because you already have a clear picture of which products each user prefers.

That’s an orthographic corrector making suggestions and pointing out spelling mistakes by searching through a dictionary.

Topological Sort,"Topological sorting is a technique used to organize a collection of items or tasks based on their dependencies. 

Imagine there is a list of tasks to complete, but some tasks can only be done after others are finished. There are many such tasks that depend on each other, or there’s a specific sequence of actions that must be followed.

 For example, when baking a cake, there are several steps one needs to follow, and some steps depend on others. We can’t frost the cake until it’s baked, and we can’t bake it until we’ve mixed the batter. To ensure that we don’t frost the cake before baking it or mix the batter after preheating the oven, we need to sort the steps based on their dependencies. 

This is where topological sorting helps us. It figures out the correct sequence of steps to bake the cake efficiently

Inverted Index Patterns,,"The algorithm's structure is analogous to how search engines like Google or Elasticsearch handle indexing and querying:

• Preprocessing Phase:
    ◦ The algorithm preprocesses the input (A commands) by building the keywordIndex that links keywords (or phrases) to log entries.
    ◦ Each log entry is tokenized into individual keywords and optionally stored as a compound phrase.

• Query Phase:
    ◦ The algorithm uses the inverted index to quickly retrieve relevant logs for a Q command by looking up keywords or phrases.
