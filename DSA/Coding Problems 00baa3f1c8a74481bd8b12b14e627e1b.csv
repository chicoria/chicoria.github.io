First Bad Version,O(1),O(log (n)),,"May 8, 2024 11:55 AM",,"Optimized approach using modified binary search
Since the versions range is sorted, binary search is the most efficient approach for finding the first bad version. It executes in 𝑂(log⁡𝑛) time, which is faster than the alternate linear scanning method.

Our goal is to find the first bad version by making the minimum number of calls to the API function. We use the binary search algorithm. The idea is to check the middle version to see if it’s bad. 

If it’s good, this means that the first bad version occurs later in the range, allowing us to entirely skip checking the first half of the range. 

If it’s bad, we need to check the first half of the range to find the first bad version. Therefore, we can skip checking the second half of the range.
When we go to check the identified half of the range, we use the same approach again. We check the middle version to figure out which half of the current range to check.","May 13, 2024 1:56 PM",,Modified Binary Search (Coding%20Patterns/Modified%20Binary%20Search%20504d9582eab543d0af5daffc2f82efc8.html),"The latest version of a software product fails the quality check.

For a given project 𝑖i, its capital requirement is 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑠[𝑖]capitals[i] , and the profit it yields is 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑠[𝑖]profits[i].

The goal is to maximize their cumulative capital by selecting a maximum of k distinct projects to invest in, subject to the constraint that the investor’s current capital must be greater than or equal to the capital requirement of all selected projects.

When a selected project from the identified ones is finished, the pure profit from the project, along with the starting capital of that project is returned to the investor. This amount will be added to the total capital held by the investor. Now, the investor can invest in more projects with the new total capital. It is important to note that each project can only be invested once.

As a basic risk-mitigation measure, the investor wants to limit the number of projects they invest in. For example, if k is 22, the program should identify the two projects that maximize the investor’s profits while ensuring that the investor’s capital is sufficient to invest in the projects.

You’re given a dictionary, dictionary, consisting of prefixes, and a sentence, sentence, which has words separated by spaces only. Your task is to replace the postfix in sentence with their prefixes given in dictionary (if found) and return the modified sentence.

A couple of points to keep in mind:
• If a postfix in the sentence matches more than one prefix in the dictionary, replace it with the prefix that has the shortest length. For example, if we have the sentence “iphone is amazing”, and the dictionary {“i”, “ip”, “hone”}, then the word “iphone” has two prefixes in the dictionary “i” and “ip”, but we will replace it with the one that is shorter among the two, that is, “i”.
